# Foxes-Rabbits population simulation 
* Here is a population sim implemented in java, where the user chooses the steps and the program shows how the number of each population progresses at each step
* Foxes are the X's and rabbits are the O's on the projected grid
* Rabbits either move or repoduce themselves and foxes move, can eat a rabbit at a neighboring cell, reproduce or die due starvation
* ~2021
