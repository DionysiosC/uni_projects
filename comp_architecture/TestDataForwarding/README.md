## Problem statement:
Create a MIPS assembly verification program which tests the data forwarding pipeline logic of a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor.
 
## Files to work on
* `testForwarding.asm` 
* `README.md` to add your name<br/>
      

## Automatic testing 
There is no automatic testing in this lab.

## Notes
* Your code should assemble and run on Mars with value 0 (all tests pass) on register $v1 at exit.
* You must only use the supported MIPS instructions. These are the same as in lab04.
* Make sure your last push is before the deadline. Your last push will be considered as your final submission.
* If you need a deadline extension for any reason, use the [provided form.](https://forms.gle/mNZjzfxBsYS9kH9G9)
* Post questions on [Piazza!](https://piazza.com/uoi.gr/fall2021/myy505/home).
